### Why do we need to contribute?
- As life gives us lemon, give it back... |
- Not many person know how/why/what to learn in IT world |
- Let's make our country better! |
- Religious persons? This maybe one of your way to pave the way to heaven.. |

---
### They key to this movement?
- Remote work! |
- Don't go to Jakarta. |
- Stay at your your own village. |
- Build it! |

+++
### So, what is CoderDojo?
- It's a global volunteer-led community of free programming clubs for your people between 7-17 |
- Founded in July 2011 by two self-taught programmers: James Whelton and Bill Liao |
- It's now already spread into 600 dojos across 60 countries |
- In 2015, Salesforce announced partnership and gives IDR 2,6M to support 14 CoderDojo |
- No direct management from central dojo into each dojo: anyone can open up their own Dojo. You just need to have the same spirit, space and time to do so |

+++
### PAY IT FORWARD
- The power is in reduplication |
- Think of how to implement this in your own home |
- We'll help each other |

### Customizing CoderDojo for Indonesia
- Open up communication with your Ketua RT/Kepala Dukuh/Kepala Desa. Let's them know! |
- If you prepare snack/lunch, talk to your neighbourhood. Let's them prepare it |
- For funding, be creative. Beside free teaching, you can also regularly open up small paid workshop/courses/seminar |
- Or, proposed up to all those rich Local Startup: they'll gain benefit of us too! |
